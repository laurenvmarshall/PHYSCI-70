  ### Week 3: Kinetic Sculpture

 <h2> The Spiral


</h2>
      
<p> I began with the idea of a barbershop’s spiralling sign. I wanted to create something that takes advantage of a simple motion to create an interesting visual effect. <br> <br>
I wanted to create a spiral and initially thought about manipulating a material so it can be twisted into a spiral, but ended up decided on a stacking technique so that potentially a later version could have lights inside, or some other visual effect. <br> <br>
I initially wanted to use either wood or acrylic; acrylic so it could be used as a lamp, or wood so that the slabs could be arranged to produce a ‘slit’ light effect. <br> <br>
I ended up going for wood because there wasn’t enough acrylic in the shop to produce the number of layers I would have liked—although in practice the borders of my squares were too thick to have gaps for light to emit. <br> <br>
Cutting the squares took a long time! After they were all printed I stacked them individually and hot glued them into the spiral. I just eyeballed the rotation each time and the stacked effect was pretty effective—although if i had measured it I could have made the top and bottom end up at the same angle. <br> <br>

Onto the motor: Gabby super super generously explained the motor mechanism and circuit to me even though it wasn’t her OH (thank you!!!). I was able to set up the motor with a USB power connection and connect it to a wooden base with hot glue. I then joined a rotating square piece the same size as the spiral pieces with hot glue. <br> <br>

<strong> Disaster Strikes! </strong> <br>
Unfortunately something I did with the hot glue that is causing the motor to short circuit (thank you again to Gabby for testing all the different components of my circuit to figure out what was wrong!!). So at the moment my kinetic sculpture is only somewhat kinetic :(, and I was short on time before class (had hogged the laser cutter long enough already) to reconstruct the base section. BUT I will do it asap after class. For now, here is my kinetic-ish sculpture: <br> <br>
