 ### Week 4: Electronic Input Devices

 <h2> Making a Super Simple Piezo Sensor Circuit

</h2>


<p> 
  This week we learned about various sensors in class. I think that my final project will likely use a lot of simple sensors, so of course I listened extra carefully.
 <br> <br>
In class we learned how to make a capacative sensor, which could measure things like how much liquid is left in a container, or to detect touch on, say, a touch screen. Using an electrical field a capacitive sensor can detect the presence of certain liquids or solids without touch. Pretty cool. Here is that Daniella and I produced in that lab session:

For my other sensor, I decided to use the piezo disc. In a way piezos are one of the reasons I took this class: an old electronic music teacher of mine told me when I was a kid that all you needed to make an instrument was a battery and a piezo (presumably the buzzer too), but I went to the hardware store afterwards and bought a piezo disc just like the one I used here... and then nothing. I had no idea what to do with it. Well, now I do! (ish)

I made a super simple circuit with the piezo. I first noticed that the red LED was responsive to touch, but initially I had issues with getting the monitor to work with the code I was using.<br> <br>

This is the very simple code I used that eventually worked:
</p>
 <pre>
  <code>
const int PIEZO_PIN = A0; // Piezo output

void setup() 
{
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() 
{
  // Read Piezo ADC value in, and convert it to a voltage
  int piezoADC = analogRead(PIEZO_PIN);
  float piezoV = piezoADC / 1023.0 * 5.0;
  Serial.println(piezoV); // Print the voltage.
}
  </code>
</pre>
<p2> I know this is the simplest little circuit and most basic code, but I was very excited when I managed to get it to work! I am very bad at making circuits. <br> When I opened up the Serial Monitor on Arduino, I saw a flow of numbers around 5.00, which would reduce when I tapped/pressed on the disc. When I opened up the Serial Plotter, this is what I saw.
