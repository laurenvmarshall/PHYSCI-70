 ### Week 7: Electronic Output Devices

 <h2> Making a Light Theramin (the Theramini!)

</h2>


<p>

  Since this week's project was to utilise both input and output devices, I thought it would be a great opportunity to make something I've always wanted to have: a theramin. It's an instrument that adjusts pitch based on the distance of the player's hand from the sensor.
 <br> <br>
Most of the tutorials I looked up used ultrasonic sensors to make the theramin. I couldn't immediately find those in the shop but thought that a photo resistor would be an easy substitute that would also be fairly effective!
<br> <br>
For this project I used a photoresistor, a 220 Ohm resistor, a piezo buzzer, and of course wires and my Arduino Uno!
<br> <br>
I put the circuit together as such: <br>

I also used instructions from this guide!
<br> <br>
Here is my code:
</p>

 <pre>
  <code>
int analogPin = A0; // Input from photoresistor connected to A0
int buzzerPin = 4; // Positive buzzer pin connected to pin 4

long max_frequency = 2500; // Max frequency for the buzzer

long frequency; // The frequency to buzz the buzzer
int readVal; // The input voltage read from photoresistor


void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
    pinMode(buzzerPin, OUTPUT); // set a pin for buzzer output
    
}

void loop() {
    readVal = analogRead(analogPin); // Reads 0-1023
    frequency = (readVal * max_frequency) / 200;
    buzz(buzzerPin, frequency, 2);

    Serial.print(readVal);
    Serial.print(",");
}

void buzz(int targetPin, long frequency, long length) {
    long delayValue = 1000000/frequency/2;
    long numCycles = frequency * length/ 1000;

    for (long i=0; i < numCycles; i++) {
        digitalWrite(targetPin,HIGH);
        delayMicroseconds(delayValue);
        digitalWrite(targetPin,LOW);
        delayMicroseconds(delayValue);
    }
}
  </code>

When I loaded the code I initially had a problem where the buzzer wasn't changing pitch. Ibrahim helped diagnose the issue: first we went through the circuit, which was fine. (although the buzzer required some light wire repair) Next, we looked at the code. The initial code that I was using was not sensitive enough for the bright environment and the subtle changes in light from a finger. After making some edits we were able to make a crude 'theramin'

We also realised that the theramin was a lot more effective when exposed to a larger quantity of light. So using the phone flashlight I was able to achieve a wider range of pitches. <br> <br>
