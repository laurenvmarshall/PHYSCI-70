  ### Week 2: 2D Design and Cutting

<p> I am still deciding between a couple ideas for my final project.
On one hand, I initially came into the class excited to use it as a way to explore my other research interests, namely my social history research on Chinese stone quarrying, and my interest in new music composition/ electronic music.
<br>
<br>
So in one world I would love to be super wacky and experimental with this project and make a fine art/experience object that aims to incorporate the different kinds of storytelling from my other projects.
That could take the form of a wall installation which somehow allows you to peek into the histories of the material through sound and visuals. Or it could be something else altogether.
