  <p2 style="background-color: lawngreen;"> I'm a Senior studying History in Eliot House. My focus field is Modern China & my thesis research focusses on the stone mining and quarrying industries in rural China from 1978 onwards. <br>
  The aim of my work on stone is to try to unveil the worlds, histories and ecologies that are hidden in the mundane materials and infrastructures that we interact with every day. <br> The idea is that certain types of storytelling can transform the our relationships with objects, and thereby our relationships with each other. <br>
  Taking PHYSCI 70 I'm hoping to continue exploring material relationships in a new way, shifting the focus from slow-paced, large-scale infrastructure, and more towards the creativity and improvisation of the maker movement.
