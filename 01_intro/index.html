  ### Week 1: Introduction 

 <h2> Final Project Ideas


</h2>
      
<p> I am still deciding between a couple ideas for my final project.
On one hand, I initially came into the class excited to use it as a way to explore my other research interests, namely my social history research on Chinese stone quarrying, and my interest in new music composition/ electronic music.
<br>
<br>
So in one world I would love to be super wacky and experimental with this project and make a fine art/experience object that aims to incorporate the different kinds of storytelling from my other projects.
That could take the form of a wall installation which somehow allows you to peek into the histories of the material through sound and visuals. Or it could be something else altogether.

 <p2> On the other hand, there is a specific object I would love to be able to make, which has come to mind a couple of times, whilst discussing the capabilities of the class with friends.
 Talk to almost anyone with breasts, and they will (probably?!) tell you that at some point they have experienced breast tenderness/pain, especially on/around their period.
And for me, at least, massaging my breasts is something that I always mean to do. It's meant to be good for lymphatic drainage, it can help you spot any abnormalities w/ regards to cancereous growths, and a lot of the time it relieves soreness and tenderness.
<br>
<br>
However, I have not seen any products available that are specifically breast massagers, despite there being lots of other massage tools available. When I looked online, I could only find breast pumps for nursing women and suspicious looking "breast enlargement" massagers. So there is a device that I would love to make, and I know that my friends and I, at least, would love to use. 
<br>
<br>
So in that case, it would be super cool to make a 'smart bra' or some kind of wearable device which can do a breast massage, and maybe have some other features like heat, vibration, and super aspirationally maybe some way of alerting you to abnormalities in the breast, like growths, etc, prompting you to get it checked out by a professional.
