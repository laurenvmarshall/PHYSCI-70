  ### Week 2: 2D Design and Cutting

<p> For this week's assignment to create a household object through 2D design, I wanted to create something that I could use in my dorm room, just because I have never been able to create something in a Harvard class before that I would keep for anything other than sentimental reasons...
<br>
<br>
I started coming up with ideas just by googling projects that slot together. One of my coolest travel memories is spending time in China, where I visited ancient buildings in Guizhou which had intricate wooden roofs that slotted together. Unlikely that I would be able to make that this week (lol).
