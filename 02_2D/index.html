  ### Week 2: 2D Design and Cutting 

 <h2> The Double Fan Jewelry Stand(?)
</h2>

<p> For this week's assignment to create a household object through 2D design, I wanted to create something that I could use in my dorm room, just because I have never been able to create something in a Harvard class before that I would keep for anything other than sentimental reasons...
<br>
<br>
I started coming up with ideas just by googling projects that slot together. One of my coolest travel memories is spending time in China, where I visited ancient buildings in Guizhou which had intricate wooden roofs that slotted together. Unlikely that I would be able to make that this week (lol).

 <p2> I was inspired by the shelf designs (above) which was made up of two intersecting fans, designed by Maryam Pousti of Studio Pousti. I liked the idea of making a mini version, which could work as a desktop jewelry holder. However, since this was my first time making something like this, I thought I would go for a super simple, trellis like design. You can see in my sketches below I tried drawing out the Pousti design, and then switched over to a more simple shape.
